# Python Data Structures Practice - WGU MSSWEAIE

Welcome to the **Python Data Structures Practice** repository! This educational resource is specifically designed for students in WGU's Master of Science in Software Engineering - AI Engineering program.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Master Python data structure fundamentals
- Practice real-world data manipulation scenarios  
- Build confidence with slicing, indexing, and operations
- Prepare for advanced AI/ML data handling

## üìö Interactive Learning Path

### Core Exercises
1. **[Lists Basics](01_lists_basics.ipynb)** - Foundation list operations (slicing, indexing)
2. **[Dictionaries Basics](02_dictionaries_basics.ipynb)** - Key-value mappings and lookups  
3. **[Sets Basics](03_sets_basics.ipynb)** - Unique collections and set operations
4. **[Combined Practice](04_combined_practice.ipynb)** - Integration of all three structures
5. **[AI Scenarios](05_ai_scenarios.ipynb)** - AI/ML relevant applications

### üß† ADHD-Friendly Design
- **Short, focused exercises** (~30-45 minutes each)
- **Clear visual separation** of concepts
- **Multiple solution approaches** provided
- **Step-by-step progression** with immediate feedback

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chevyphillip/python-data-structures-practice.git
cd python-data-structures-practice

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### Option 2: Using pip
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chevyphillip/python-data-structures-practice.git
cd python-data-structures-practice

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```
