# GitHub Actions Deprecated Actions Fix - Summary

## Problem
The repository was encountering an error about deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` being used in GitHub Pages deployment:

```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`. Learn more: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/
```

## Root Cause
The error was coming from GitHub's automatically generated workflow for GitHub Pages deployment. When you enable GitHub Pages for a repository with Jekyll content, GitHub automatically creates workflows that were using the deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action.

## Solution Implemented
Created a custom GitHub Pages deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) that:

1. **Uses Current Actions**: Replaced deprecated actions with current versions:
   - `actions/checkout@v4` (latest)
   - `actions/configure-pages@v5` (latest)
   - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` (current for Pages-specific uploads)
   - `actions/deploy-pages@v4` (latest)

2. **Proper Workflow Structure**: 
   - Separate build and deploy jobs
   - Correct permissions (`pages: write`, `id-token: write`)
   - Proper concurrency handling

3. **Jekyll Support**: 
   - Added `Gemfile` with proper Jekyll dependencies
   - Uses `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` with bundler caching
   - Builds with production environment

## Key Differences from Deprecated Approach

### ❌ OLD (Deprecated):
- Used `actions/upload-artifact@v3` (general-purpose action)
- GitHub's automatic workflow with deprecated actions

### ✅ NEW (Fixed):
- Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` (Pages-specific action)
- Custom workflow with latest action versions
- Proper Jekyll dependency management

## Files Added/Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/pages.yml`** - Custom GitHub Pages deployment workflow
2. **`Gemfile`** - Jekyll dependencies for bundler

## Expected Outcome

- ✅ No more deprecation warnings
- ✅ Faster deployments with latest actions
- ✅ Better reliability with Pages-specific actions
- ✅ Proper Jekyll dependency management
- ✅ Automatic deployment on pushes to main branch

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the workflow runs at: `https://github.com/chevyphillip/python-data-structures-practice/actions`
2. Verify the GitHub Pages site deploys successfully
3. Consider merging this branch to main to apply the fix
