## üîß Core Python Built-ins for Optimization

### Essential Functions

#### `zip()` - Parallel Iteration
```python
# Basic: Manual index tracking
for i in range(len(list1)):
    process(list1[i], list2[i])

# Optimized: Parallel iteration
for item1, item2 in zip(list1, list2):
    process(item1, item2)

# Advanced: Chunking data
def chunk_data(data, size):
    return zip(*[iter(data)] * size)
```

**Performance**: ~25% faster than manual indexing
**Use Case**: Processing multiple related sequences simultaneously

#### `enumerate()` - Index-Value Pairs
```python
# Basic: Manual counter
i = 0
for item in items:
    process(i, item)
    i += 1

# Optimized: Built-in enumeration
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    process(i, item)
```

**Performance**: ~15% faster, more readable
**Use Case**: When you need both index and value

#### `map()` - Function Application
```python
# Basic: List comprehension
result = [func(x) for x in items]

# Optimized: Map function
result = list(map(func, items))

# Advanced: With operator module
from operator import mul
result = list(map(mul, list1, list2))
```

**Performance**: Similar to comprehensions, more functional style
**Use Case**: Applying functions to all items in a sequence

#### `filter()` - Conditional Selection
```python
# Basic: List comprehension with condition
result = [x for x in items if condition(x)]

# Optimized: Filter function
result = list(filter(condition, items))

# Advanced: With lambda or built-in functions
result = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, items))
```

**Performance**: Similar to comprehensions, memory-efficient as generator
**Use Case**: Selecting items based on conditions

#### `any()` / `all()` - Boolean Operations
```python
# Basic: Manual boolean checking
has_positive = False
for x in numbers:
    if x > 0:
        has_positive = True
        break

# Optimized: Built-in any()
has_positive = any(x > 0 for x in numbers)

# All items check
all_positive = all(x > 0 for x in numbers)
```

**Performance**: Short-circuits on first match, very efficient
**Use Case**: Boolean conditions across collections

### Dictionary Optimization

#### `dict.get()` - Safe Access
```python
# Basic: Manual key checking
if key in dictionary:
    value = dictionary[key]
else:
    value = default

# Optimized: get() method
value = dictionary.get(key, default)
```

**Performance**: ~20% faster, more concise
**Use Case**: Accessing dictionary values with fallbacks

#### `collections.defaultdict` - Automatic Defaults
```python
# Basic: Manual initialization
groups = {}
for item in items:
    key = get_key(item)
    if key not in groups:
        groups[key] = []
    groups[key].append(item)

# Optimized: defaultdict
from collections import defaultdict
groups = defaultdict(list)
for item in items:
    groups[get_key(item)].append(item)
```

**Performance**: ~30% faster, eliminates key checking
**Use Case**: Grouping operations, counting, accumulation

#### `collections.Counter` - Frequency Counting
```python
# Basic: Manual counting
counts = {}
for item in items:
    counts[item] = counts.get(item, 0) + 1

# Optimized: Counter
from collections import Counter
counts = Counter(items)

# Advanced operations
most_common = counts.most_common(5)
total = sum(counts.values())
```

**Performance**: ~40% faster (C implementation)
**Use Case**: Frequency analysis, statistics

### Set Operations

#### Set Operators vs Methods
```python
# Both are optimized, operators are more concise
intersection = set1 & set2  # set1.intersection(set2)
union = set1 | set2         # set1.union(set2)
difference = set1 - set2    # set1.difference(set2)

# Subset checking
is_subset = set1 <= set2    # set1.issubset(set2)
is_superset = set1 >= set2  # set1.issuperset(set2)
```

**Performance**: O(min(len(s1), len(s2))) for intersection
**Use Case**: Membership testing, uniqueness, mathematical operations

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### `operator` Module - Performance Boost
```python
from operator import itemgetter, attrgetter, methodcaller

# Instead of lambda functions
sorted_data = sorted(items, key=itemgetter(1))  # vs lambda x: x[1]
sorted_objects = sorted(objects, key=attrgetter('name'))  # vs lambda x: x.name

# Method calling
results = map(methodcaller('upper'), strings)  # vs lambda x: x.upper()
```

**Performance**: ~15-25% faster than equivalent lambdas
**Use Case**: Sorting, extracting values, method application

### `itertools` - Advanced Iteration
```python
from itertools import groupby, chain, compress, islice

# Grouping consecutive elements
data = [('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 3), ('b', 4)]
for key, group in groupby(data, key=itemgetter(0)):
    print(key, list(group))

# Memory-efficient chaining
combined = chain(list1, list2, list3)  # vs list1 + list2 + list3

# Conditional selection
selected = list(compress(data, mask))  # vs [d for d, m in zip(data, mask) if m]
```

**Performance**: Memory-efficient, lazy evaluation
**Use Case**: Complex iteration patterns, memory optimization

### `functools` - Functional Programming
```python
from functools import reduce, partial, lru_cache

# Reduction operations
total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)  # vs sum(numbers)
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers, 1)

# Partial application
multiply_by_2 = partial(lambda x, y: x * y, 2)
doubled = list(map(multiply_by_2, numbers))

# Caching for expensive operations
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def expensive_function(x):
    return complex_calculation(x)
```

**Performance**: `reduce` varies, `lru_cache` can provide massive speedups
**Use Case**: Functional programming patterns, memoization
