## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chevyphillip/python-data-structures-practice.git
cd python-data-structures-practice

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### Option 2: Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chevyphillip/python-data-structures-practice.git
cd python-data-structures-practice

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## Difficulty Progression

🟢 **Beginner**: Basic operations, simple indexing
🟡 **Intermediate**: Complex slicing, nested structures
🔴 **Advanced**: Real-world scenarios, optimization

## Study Approach for ADHD Learners

✅ **Start small** - Complete one section before moving on
✅ **Test immediately** - Run each code block as you write it
✅ **Use comments** - Explain your thinking in the code
✅ **Take breaks** - Each notebook is ~30-45 minutes
