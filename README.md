## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install Jupyter**: `pip install jupyter`
3. **Start Jupyter**: `jupyter notebook`
4. **Begin with**: `01_lists_basics.ipynb`

## Difficulty Progression

🟢 **Beginner**: Basic operations, simple indexing
🟡 **Intermediate**: Complex slicing, nested structures
🔴 **Advanced**: Real-world scenarios, optimization

## Study Approach for ADHD Learners

✅ **Start small** - Complete one section before moving on
✅ **Test immediately** - Run each code block as you write it
✅ **Use comments** - Explain your thinking in the code
✅ **Take breaks** - Each notebook is ~30-45 minutes

## Support

Each exercise includes:

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Helpful hints
- Common mistake warnings
- Multiple solution approaches
